# Chat

Friday is a chatbot so these are the ways to make sure that if Friday has a response that you get that response

- Mentioning Friday (or using a reply) eg.

  ```none
  @Friday hey, how are you?
  ```

- [Setting a channel to be the chat channel](/commands/server_moderation/#chatchannel). Friday will (try to) respond to every message in that channel as if they were directed to Friday.
