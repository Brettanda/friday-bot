## How do commands

### Prefix

The default prefix for Friday's commands is `!`, and for commands to execute every command needs this prefix or the custom prefix that you can set with the [prefix](commands/server_moderation/#prefix) command.

### Command aliases and the meaning of |

Commands can have aliases and the way that they are displayed and seperated here are with `|`, for example if you see a command displayed as

```md
!rps|rockpaperscissors <choice>
```

then both of these will execute the command.

```md
!rps <choice>
```

and

```md
!rockpaperscissors <choice>
```

### Arguments



## Languages

Friday can speak every language available to Google translate, but can only speak one language at a time per server. To change which language Friday will respond in and to, simply use the following the [language command](commands/moderation/#language).
