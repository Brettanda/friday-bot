## How do commands

### Prefix

The default prefix for Friday's commands is `!`, and for commands to execute every command needs this prefix or the custom prefix that you can set with the [prefix](/commands/server_moderation/#prefix) command.

### How to read the commands

## Languages

Friday can speak every language available to Google translate, but can only speak one language at a time per server. To change which language Friday will respond in and to simply use the following command.

```md
!lang <language>

eg.
!lang spanish
!lang es
```
