# FAQ

## Why is Friday not responding to me

Friday will respond to @mentions, if you reply to a message from Friday or the channel is set to be a chat channel with [`!chatchannel`](/commands/moderation/#chatchannel). If Friday still doesn't respond then please let me know in the [#issues](https://discord.com/channels/707441352367013899/707518738890620959/872081826229919744){:target="_blank"} channel in the [support server](http://discord.gg/XP4avQ449V){:target="_blank"}

## Why is Friday repeating herself?

Because Friday "thinks"/generates her own responses I am not currently sure why this is happening (lol). The current workaround is to use the [`!reset`](/commands/chat/#reset) command, which resets her chat history
